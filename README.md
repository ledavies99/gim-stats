## Getting Started

### Backend (Django)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
4. The backend API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Frontend (React)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the React dev server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
3. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000/

## Environment Variables
- Backend: Configure Django settings as needed (see `settings.py`).
- Frontend: Set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/.env` to your backend API root (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`).

## Deployment
- Use your preferred platform.
- Backend and frontend can be deployed separately.
- Run `python manage.py collectstatic` before deploying backend to production.

## Static Files
- Place source static assets in `backend/static/`.
- `staticfiles/` is generated by Django and should not be committed to git.
